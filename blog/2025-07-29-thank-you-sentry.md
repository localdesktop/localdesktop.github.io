I'm excited to share and express my gratitude for **Sentry**'s approval of our application to their Open Source Sponsorship Plan ðŸŽ‰

If you're maintaining an open-source project, you can apply [here](https://sentry.io/for/open-source/). Having Sentry for telemetry helps more than you might expect. Before using Sentry, we had to ask users to connect their devices to a PC via USB, capture logcat output, and send it to us via email or GitHub. Now, panic reports are automatically sent to us with detailed context, helping us quickly identify which assumptions or expectations went wrong, and take timely action.

We also plan to make further use of Sentry by leveraging traces and spans to monitor FPS and frame delays. This will help us optimize the app's smoothness even more.
