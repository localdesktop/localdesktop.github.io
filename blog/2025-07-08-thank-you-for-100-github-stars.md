Local Desktop just reached 100 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/localdesktop/localdesktop) 🎉
What surprised me even more was a sudden wave of traffic from Brazil. Obrigado 🇧🇷

Your support means the world to us, and we will keep working hard to make Local Desktop better every version. We are working on handling better mouse/trackpad input, and our next plan is to support an Android storage mount point.
