Local Desktop just crossed **1,000 stars on GitHub** 🌟⭐️💫🥂🎉🎊🪅

I'm super surprised as I started this project as a hobby, but now it has grown into something much bigger than I imagined. Of course there is more pressure to keep the community satisfied, but in the end, I'm super grateful for the interest the community has shown towards this project.

Since the 100 GitHub stars milestone, there hasn't been much development except for the [support of Android storage mount point](https://github.com/localdesktop/localdesktop/releases/tag/v1.4.7). I recently relocated from Vietnam to Germany, and in the small allocated time I have left, I'm reading about processes in Linux and understanding how audio works in Linux, similar to how I spent time researching how the graphics stack works with Wayland. And that's what I'm working on:
- **Audio support**, either via PulseAudio or PipeWire.
- **Native PTrace in Rust**, you can think of it like a built-in PRoot. With this, I expect to fix the most reported issue: "Device Unsupported!" 😂

Also as the project grows, it becomes hard to maintain by just one person. So I'm welcoming everyone, regardless of whether you are a developer, or wanting to become one, or just interested in the project, to help:

- Work on code
- Improve documentation
- Clean up duplicate issues

One more time, thank you for your support 🙏 Looking forward to a future where Android can do almost anything.
